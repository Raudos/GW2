# GW2 API Playground

Playground for https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/API:2

## Built With

* [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
* [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) - Build native mobile apps using JavaScript and React
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - A predictable state container for JavaScript apps
* [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) - Routing and navigation for your React Native apps

## Difficulties

Current GW2 Api has severe request limits, which means that user might be cut off from it during the usage.
Research needed for suplementary data source like avatars, images, icons and fluff text. (https://github.com/madou/armory-embeds)
